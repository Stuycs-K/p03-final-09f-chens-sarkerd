## Group Members:

Sean Chen

# Intentions:

Server that allows clients to connect two at a time to play battleship against each other, can handle multiple instances. 


# Intended usage:

Prompts the players for ship position, where to throw bombs. 
  
# Technical Details:

Sockets : server and clients, manage messages, manage matchmaking - Both

Allocating Memory : managing ships and grid - Debojit

Signals : catch keyboard inputs - Sean

Processes: allows our server to handle multiple matches - Both

[Possible Extras if Time]

Files + Finding Info About Files : Leaderboard with match wins and usernames
    
# Intended pacing:

1/9: Working Server System/Forks

1/12: Server has to handle at least one battleship match  

1/16: Polished game, file stuff if extra time
